PatternModel
    - class encoding version
    - stores patterns? 
    - stores pointers?  If yes, then it also has a corpus included


read  PatternPointerMap as PatternMap: yes
write PatternPointerMap as PatternMap: yes

read PatternMap as PatternPointerMap: no
write PatternMap as PatternPointerMap: no


PatternModel can be based either PatternMap or PatternPointerMap (different type)
